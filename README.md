## About Marc

I am an 18-year-old computer science student from Barcelona who is deeply curious and loves getting involved in projects. I built Offerty, a Google Maps-style app for local deals, and founded Footinn, which grew to 4,000+ members across Europe. I spent my junior year in the United States and currently work as a research assistant on an ML project at Stanford University. When I am not building, I enjoy running, playing tennis, and hiking.

### Main Achievements

- **FSL-Net - Research Assistant, Stanford University (Feb 2026 - Present):** Extending a state-of-the-art neural network (FSL-Net) for feature-level distribution shift detection to infer feature importance.
- **Offerty - Co-founder (Jul 2025 - Dec 2025):** Built a mobile marketplace (iOS/Android) for discovering and purchasing local discounts, featuring map-based discovery, QR/wallet redemption, appointment booking, a React merchant dashboard, and a vector-database recommendation system using location and interaction signals.  
  Demo: <https://offerty.es/>
- **Footinn - Founder (May 2022 - Aug 2023):** Founded a sneaker reselling community at 15 and scaled it from 0 to 4,000+ members across Europe in under a year, before being acquired by a UK competitor.  
  Profile: <https://x.com/footinncg>
- **Centauri (Hackathon Project):** Multimodal AI browser copilot that adds a natural-language layer to any webpage, enabling context-aware chat or autonomous agent actions (scrolling, clicking, typing, data extraction), with pinned spatial notes, image context, and voice interaction.

## How I Work

- **Gets me pumped:** Good energy, shipping fast, building new features, UI, music.
- **Disappoints me:** Over-complicating things, burocracy, disrespect.
- **Strengths:** Ideas into products quickly, planning, resilience, and strong self-discipline.
- **Improvement points:** Delegating, balancing focus with flexibility, managing time across multiple projects.
- **Known behaviours / comms style:** Using english words when writing in Spanish, not stopping until something is fixed, humor.

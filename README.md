## About Marc

I'm an 18y/o builder from Barcelona who loves getting involved in projects and shipping fast. I built Offerty, a Google Maps style app for local discounts, and Footinn, a sneaker reselling community with over 4000 users. I studied in the United States during my junior year, where I discovered the startup ecosystem and have been drawn to it ever since. When I am not building, I enjoy running, playing tennis, and going on hikes.
